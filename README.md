## Objective: Test cases and Test automation 

1. Please navigate to the following sample application: http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers
2. Select one of the computers and create a series of manual test cases that cover the CRUD operation plus the edge cases.
   Make sure that you give detailed instructions for each test case (step preconditions, steps to execute test case, expected results, etc).
   You can use any format you prefer.
3. Decide which test cases are you going to automate. You can use any open source tool prefer. Write documentation on how to run tests with the chosen tool.
